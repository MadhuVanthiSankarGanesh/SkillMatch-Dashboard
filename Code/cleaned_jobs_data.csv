3859082046,Part-Time Medical Assistant/LPN,Peak Interactive Wellness,35490496,"Company DescriptionWe all want to feel like ourselves and live our whole story. At Peak Interactive Wellness, we believe your mental health doesn’t make up the entirety of who you are. Whether you’ve been navigating a life transition, recently experienced a traumatic event, or are simply exhausted from trying so hard — you want to feel like yourself again. We’ve been in similar situations, combatted mental health conditions ourselves, and worked in psychiatric nursing environments that didn’t value patients’ voices — and we didn’t like how we were treated. So we set a new standard for patient care by being one of the first practices to adopt a telehealth model for interactive, in-home services. Which is why we take a humanistic and positive psychiatry approach to treating a variety of psychiatric disorders and all ages ranging from preschool through adulthood. We support you with short-term treatment plans because we know you don’t want to be on medication forever. We make medication decisions with you, not for you, and we provide alternative treatment options and therapies. We fight the stigma around mental health medication because being in a steady-state is more important than suffering in shame and silence. We don’t just prescribe prescriptions — we’re here to combine test results and cutting-edge treatment modalities with creating balance using the basics of self-care and removing barriers to getting support. We work closely with other members of your health care team to form a collaborative approach to your treatment. We are Peak Interactive Wellness, a private psychiatric practice specializing in medication management for mental health — and all the pieces that make up who you are — so you can keep living your story.
